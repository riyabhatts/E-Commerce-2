This is a static clone of the **Myntra home page**, created using **HTML** and **CSS**. This project was built as part of my front-end development learning journey to practice layout building and styling based on real-world websites.

## 🔍 Overview

The goal of this project was to understand how professional e-commerce layouts are structured and styled. I focused on the **visual UI**, including the header, navigation, banners, and basic layout — keeping it simple and beginner-friendly.
